- 👋 Hi, I’m @mr-ollivander
- 👀 I’m interested in technical documentation. I like researching different topics and learn a little about them in depth.  
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to enhance my documentation skills, particularly for the open-source environment. Recently, I've learned how to properly use Markdown.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the documentation aspects of open-source projects. I'm looking to build up my skills in reading and interpreting code and properly summarizing the changes.
